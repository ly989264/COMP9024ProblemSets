Given the following definition:
int data[12] = {5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1, 8};
and assuming that &data[0] == 0x10000, what are the values of the following expressions?

0x10000 means that this is a hexadecimal number. And int is a 4-byte primitive data type.

data + 4: 0x10010 (0x10000+4*4) //note that this is the hexadecimal number, so the result should be 0x10010 rather than 0x10016!!!
*data + 4: 9
*(data + 4): 7
data[4]: 7
*(data + *(data + 3)): 6
data[data[2]]: 9
